# Docker Compose with Jenkins

Hi. In this learning module I'm going to teach you about Docker Compose

If you're not familiar with Jenkins or Docker Compose don't worry, we'll be taking you through what you need to know as we go.

The first module goes over the setting up of Compose and a basic Jenkins example, while the second module shows a more complex scenario involving a configurable ssh slave.
